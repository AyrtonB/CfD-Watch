# CfD Watch

> This repository includes code for retrieving the latest data on UK CfD strike prices

Less than a month after the creation of this project the LCCC have released an <a href="https://www.lowcarboncontracts.uk/data-portal/dataset/?tags=CfD">open, machine-readable, portal</a> enabling easy access to the data this repository was created for, my hope is that other energy data organisations will also follow the recommendations of the Energy Data Taskforce and make it easier to interface with these resources at their source. <b>This project will no longer be maintained and the automated data retrieval has been stopped.</b>
